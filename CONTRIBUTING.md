## New content releasing
As Honkai: Star Rail developes, there will be more and more information each update that Hoyoverse releases. With new information from the following:
- Official Livestreams
- Official Tweets
- Other Official Sources

When they release new content, **you are allowed to edit and or make new pages for that content.**

Any other sources such as **rumors and or leaks are not permitted.**

## Page ownership
If you were to create a page for the website, you will be credited in the about page of the website. Following your name will be anyone who updates the page with information (if they want to be credited). <br> This is a community driven project, there is no one person who owns it all.

## Closing
KittenzExe here, this project wont be possible without a community. If you have any info you would like to add, please, don't hesitate. Even if you don't have any coding experience, even adding a sentence or two can help a lot. I wish I could do this all day every day but I simply can't. Your help will be much appreciated.
